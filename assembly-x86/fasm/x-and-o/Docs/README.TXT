WHAT IS XAN?
=====================
   XAN, meaning  Cross & Naught,  is yet another  small  tic-tac-toe
   game written  solely  in  Assembly language.  XAN was implemented
   intentionally to  exercise my knowledge of  video programming and
   develop some classes for my routine library project.	This release
   is only alpha, hence, it doesn't support a lot of important gaming
   features.

INTRODUCTORY FEATURES
=====================
   The following features  are the first features which XAN provides
   for users:
	 1. Arrow keys navigations instead of the unorthodox  "WDSA"
	    keys
	 2. Grid tiles are  highlighted when  cursor passes  on them
	 3. Player colour toggles between Player1 or Player2 depending
	    on who's turn it is.

HOW TO USE
=====================
   Run XAN.EXE. You should see a window pop up, then goes into full-
   screen. Use the following controls to play the game:
	 1. Up	  - Move up
	 2. Right - Move right
	 3. Down  - Move down
	 4. Left  - Move left
	 5. Space - Mark player's colour in selected tile
	 6. Esc   - Exit the game

WHAT'S NEXT
=====================
   I suppose there will be another release of this game and of course
   a better version. Here is an assorted list of what I plan for  the
   next release:
	 * Implement rounds and scores for players into game.
	 * Players should be able to select their own  colour from  a
	   a list of colours.
	 * Outlining each tile (block) with a design.
