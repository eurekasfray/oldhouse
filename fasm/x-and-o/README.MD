# XAN: x-and-o

XAN (or X&O or cross-and-naught) is an unfinished tic-tac-toe game I created and finished in late 2010. XAN is written in the x86 assembly language and is assembled using the [FASM](https://flatassembler.net) assembler. The game was implemented intentionally to exercise my knowledge of video programming.

Watch the MP4 videos in the `Docs` directories to see how the game works.


I must say that this project was very fun &mdash; especially the parts where I created my own font and was able to render a string to the screen as a graphic text. The most difficult part on the other hand was writing the actual game logic of determining which player one.
